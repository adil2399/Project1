<h1>Adil Shah</h1>
<h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I am a first class graduate in mathematics who has a love for problem solving. I enjoy playing badminton and going to the gym every week as I strive to always better myself everyday. I am diligent, analytically minded and resilient. These qualities drove me to a new found passion in coding. The technology industry has been rapidly growing over the years and is ever evolving, and I would love to make my mark in helping create an advanced future. </p>
